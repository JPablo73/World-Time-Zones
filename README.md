# World Time Zones

 https://jpablo73.github.io/time-zone/
 
App will display local time and date of city chosen from the drop-down menu.  Second card will display a random event that took place on that date in history.

I contributed to this group project in the design of the webpage. I wrote the HTML and CSS code. Bulma CSS framework was used for layout and styling.
